              "text": "[@Dominic](@EMovhfIrFk4NihAKnRNhrfRaqIhBv1Wj8pTxJNgvCCY=.ed25519) I'm not suggesting that there shouldn't be any kind of efforts done to level the playing field on various topics such as employment, but rather, that those who advocate for discriminatory practices to do so (i don't consider, nor would I think any sane person consider, removing gendered names from a CV for instance, as being discriminatory).\n\nMy problem is strictly with the discriminatory activities some folks advocate to level the playing field. That is to say, ruling folks out for positions or opportunities based solely on their race, gender, etc. \n\n[@dinosaur](@6ilZq3kN0F+dXFHAPjAwMm87JEb/VdB+LC9eIMW3sa0=.ed25519) I do agree that there are systemic biases that lead to unequal opportunity and distribution of wealth irrespective of other factors. I also agree that we, collectively need to do something to address such imbalances. That said, aims to strive for 50/50 equality generally tend to lead down to discriminatory paths when folks run out of other ideas, which turns more people against doing what they could otherwise be doing to help with this imbalance and serves to further hurt the situation than help it.\n\nRe: You're background, I can relate to some of what you have mentioned, but others I'm a complete and total polar opposite. I come from a broken home, parents twice divorced, was moved around in child custody battles, raised in poverty. I could never afford to go to university, though I did manage to be accepted to one, though couldn't afford to go later on in life. I've worked in startups my entire professional life which to some may be a privilege, but it's not all rainbows, sunshine and money trees. I also wasn't a confident person until I told myself I was just going to fake it. That's what I attribute to actually becoming confident myself. I also identify as male, and I'm in a position to hire people. In fact, of the last 3 people who have joined my team, I've had 1 white male, 1 asian male, and 1 white female. I can't claim that no bias went into any of those hirings on anybody involve's count, but consciously what did was 1) attitude of the people we eventually hired, 2) culture fit, 3) ability to talk about their work history in an authoritative manner. I don't try and stump people with bar-style techno trivia, but I do try and use other signals to help.\n\nAnyway, claiming no moral high ground, I know I'm not without my own personal biases, including my absolute hatred of justifying discrimination (denial of opportunity).",

In 3 Commandments, there's a game master who picks the rules and win conditions at random from a deck of cards, and keeps them secret.  The players then have to make a move, not knowing any of the rules, and the game master tells them how many points they scored.  There's an incredible meta-game of superstition that emerges as players will try to copy everything the previous player did to get as many points as them, but they don't know which of the random moves were the ones that actually provided points.  It recreates the experience of walking into a bar and seeing a group of friends deep into a game you've never seen, and so it seems like pure gibberish even though they are taking it sooo seriously.

              "text": "I can not talk about Berlin, but the route that was used by a lot of refugees in the big summer of migration (2015, right? I think it was 2015) was blocked by an agreement with Turkish prime minister Erdoğan (pushed by Merkel), where EU paid Turkey 6Mio EUR to keep refugees out of the EU. Since then refugees from Middle East just don't arrive in the EU anymore.\nThe ones that still come have a much harder path ahead of them. They flee by rubber boat from the Turkis coast to reach a Greek island. I don't know how many make it and how many die, but I the situation in Greek camps is terrible.\n\nThere are also refugees from North africa, they often leave from Libya using either large rubber or wooden boats. They are told to just go north for a few miles and they will find an Italian island - which is nonsense. Usually they will either be found by a humanitarian sea rescue mission like SeaWatch or  SOS Mediterrane (who safely bring them to Italy) or by the local coastguard, who bring them back to Libya. Recently, the young fascist Identitarian Movement started to try to help the Lybian coastguard, but I don't want to know what happens to the refugees on board of their ship.\nAnyway, the situation in Italian camps is no better that in Greek camps, actually they are more like refugee slums. It's horrible.\n\nA few months back I attended a talk by someone who was volunteering on one of the humanitarian missions, and he said that there were people on the boats who said they were kidnapped and sent to the boats, and there were signs of human trafficking - as soon as people are in the refugee slums, noone knows where they will end up.\n\nAnyway, in Hamburg they have started closing some refugee shelters, because there is \"no need\". Which is not suprising if you let them die at the front door.\n\n---\n\nHuh, I guess this is one of my rants."
